# User modules

All the non-built-in modules should be installed here to preserve bot integrity. This folder will also be where the Package Manager and Sideloader will install the user modules (from [Community repos](https://github.com/prototype74/HyperUBot/wiki/Community-Repos)). Like this, the userbot will have a fully working update system.

Any of the extra modules should be updated by the user, either with a reinstall or an update, using the `.pkg` command and the right args.
